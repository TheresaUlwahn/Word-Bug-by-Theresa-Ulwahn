    <h2>Meaning </h2>

      <!-- strong to emphesize first main word -->
      <!--&#173; to make words split when changing size of the screen-->
      <p><strong>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" title="More about a software bug">bug</a></strong> is a mistake or an error made
      in a program code &#173;or also in other tech&#173;nical con&#173;struc&#173;tions and sys&#173;tems.
      It can cause problems both by giving wrong results but also be&#173;have un&#173;ex&#173;pec&#173;tedly.</p>
      <p>These problems are often fixed by the de&#173;ve&#173;lo&#173;per, and nowa&#173;days, new pro&#173;grams have point up&#173;dates
      to avoid or upgrade their launched pro&#173;grams. That is called de&#173;bugg&#173;ing.</p>

    <h2>History </h2>

      <p>To add some history to it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Mr Thomas Edison</a> himself,
      wrote a letter in 1878 re&#173;gar&#173;ding a prob&#173;lem ("bugs") that occ&#173;ured
      during his de&#173;ve&#173;lop&#173;ment of the tele&#173;graph sys&#173;tem.</p>

      <p> And in 1945 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" title="This university though..Harvard University">Harvard University</a>,
      a bug (literally one) was found in a elec&#173;tronic calcu&#173;lator, forcing it to crash. The bug which was attached to the log book is still there.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper" title="What a lady! Presenting Grace Hopper">Mrs. Grace Hopper</a>  who´s also´s called
      "Madame <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" title="What is that? COBOL">COBOL</a>",
      didn´t find the bug but she's the one using the term for the first time.</p>
